the object of the game is to keep the villagers as safe as possible. 

Zombies are green and Villagers are blue!

they will naturally run from the zombies but can't leave the window borders.
zombies will spawn on the screen every second.
use your mouse to scare the zombies away from the villagers so they survive as long as possible.

the game will close when no villagers are left alive.
